# David McArtor's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my first personal website, a canvas where I bring together my budding interest in web development, creativity, and professional exploration.

## Project Overview

This personal website is a straightforward, mostly-static one-pager that nevertheless marks an important step in my web development journey. While simple in structure, it represents a significant leap in learning the intricacies of website creation from scratch. It embodies my initial foray into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is a reflection of my commitment to self-improvement and mastering new skills. Through this project, I've laid the foundation for more complex, dynamic websites in the future.

### Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Demonstrate my ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and deployment.
- Explore the intricacies of website design and responsive styling with Tailwind CSS.
- Create an online platform that showcases my professional identity.

### Challenges and Learnings

The project started on a Jekyll template, but soon I found myself craving more freedom and flexibility. I transitioned to building the website manually, leveraging the Grimoire GPT for initial setup, troubleshooting, and JavaScript creation for dynamic elements like the rotating tagline.

Key resources that helped me along the way include:

- **Tailwind Play**: An invaluable tool for quick visual feedback during styling.
- **Scrimba's Tailwind CSS Course**: Offered hands-on learning experiences with practical projects.
- **Tailwind CSS Documentation**: A well-organized and comprehensive guide.
- **The Website Architect**: A really good Youtube channel on website design.

### Technical Framework

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Hosting/Deployment**: GitHub Pages

### Unique Features

- A dynamic hero section crafted with custom images.
- A rotating tagline powered by JavaScript.
- A site that's ready to evolve into a more complex multi-page architecture.
- Plans to include back-end databases and embedded web apps.

### Future Enhancements

- **Feedback-Driven Refinements**: Actively seeking and incorporating community feedback.
- **AI Chatbot**: A chatbot will be added to serve as a virtual assistant.
- **Multimedia Content**: Videos showcasing my language skills will be added.
- **Advanced Features**: Back-end databases and embedded web applications are on the roadmap.
- **Multi-page Layout**: Transitioning to a multi-page setup for content diversification.

## Mistakes and Lessons
- **Always read documentation!!!**  There were a number of formatting issues that just weren't resolving well, particularly with background colors and flex box design, that I couldn't understand why it wasn't working.  Testing in Tailwind Play didn't resolve the issues, and everything seemed to be working fine.  Then I carefully reread the startup guide in the Tailwind Documentation, and I quickly found that I hadn't used the appropriate link in my header.  It was confusing, because many of the stylings were working normally, but some weren't.  It took me ages to figure out the problem, but it boiled down to 15 minutes reading documentation and changing one line of code.  The lesson for me is clear: Always read the documentation!
- **Take a course or follow a tutorial; don't rely too much on AI tools.**  I tried to rely very heavily on tools like Grimoire GPT, and that was great and saved a lot of time, but I couldn't get it to produce the styles I wanted...at least not without a great deal of back and forth.  So, I decided to take a course on Tailwind on Coursera, and that made a huge difference!  After that course, I could make most of the style changes I was looking for by myself quite quickly, I could better describe style changes I wanted to AI tools if I wanted them to generate a lot of code quickly, and I learned of useful tools to quickly check what visual changes my CSS styling would have, like Tailwind Play.
- **Background images have been hard for me.**  I don't know what lesson to glean, but I really struggled with getting the background images to look right.  My hero section came out how I wanted really quickly and easily, but I struggled to get my other background images to display well, especially on mobile screens.  I tried lots of different image sizes, different file types, images with different visual compositions.  I worked a lot with AI tools to try and solve the problems, read documentation and Stack Overflow, and watched YouTube videos, but it still took a while to get it looking good.  My biggest problem was that, even using device emulators set to my exact mobile device, the display on the emulator would look good but it looked terrible on my actual phone.  This simply required a lot of iterative improvement, problem solving, and trial and error to find the look I needed.  I hope it looks alright. :)
