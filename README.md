# David McArtor's Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my first personal website, a canvas where I bring together my budding interest in web development, creativity, and professional exploration.

## Project Overview

This personal website is a straightforward, mostly-static one-pager that nevertheless marks an important step in my web development journey. While simple in structure, it represents a significant leap in learning the intricacies of website creation from scratch. It embodies my initial foray into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is a reflection of my commitment to self-improvement and mastering new skills. Through this project, I've laid the foundation for more complex, dynamic websites in the future.

### Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Demonstrate my ability to use Git and GitHub for version control and deployment.
- Explore the intricacies of website design and responsive styling with Tailwind CSS.
- Create an online platform that showcases my professional identity.

### Challenges and Learnings

The project started on a Jekyll template, but soon I found myself craving more freedom and flexibility. I transitioned to building the website manually, leveraging the Grimoire GPT for initial setup, troubleshooting, and JavaScript creation for dynamic elements like the rotating tagline.

Key resources that helped me along the way include:

- **Tailwind Play**: An invaluable tool for quick visual feedback during styling.
- **Scrimba's Tailwind CSS Course**: Offered hands-on learning experiences with practical projects.
- **Tailwind CSS Documentation**: A well-organized and comprehensive guide.
- **The Website Architect**: A really good Youtube channel on website design.

### Technical Framework

- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS (with Tailwind), JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Hosting/Deployment**: GitHub Pages

### Unique Features

- A dynamic hero section crafted with custom images.
- A rotating tagline powered by JavaScript.
- A site that's ready to evolve into a more complex multi-page architecture.
- Plans to include back-end databases and embedded web apps.

### Future Enhancements

- **Feedback-Driven Refinements**: Actively seeking and incorporating community feedback.
- **AI Chatbot**: A chatbot will be added to serve as a virtual assistant.
- **Multimedia Content**: Videos showcasing my language skills will be added.
- **Advanced Features**: Back-end databases and embedded web applications are on the roadmap.
- **Multi-page Layout**: Transitioning to a multi-page setup for content diversification.
